A new probabilistic wind speed prediction method, called Shared Weight Long Short-Term Memory Network combined with Gaussian Process Regression.
The paper of this method is available at this link (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.04.047).
If the paper or code is helpful to you, please refer to our paper or code.

note: 
(1) Due to the confidentiality of the data, the data used in the code is slightly different from the original data in the paper.
(2) The code in the paper was originally written in Java. This code is the python version, and will only be maintained in python.
